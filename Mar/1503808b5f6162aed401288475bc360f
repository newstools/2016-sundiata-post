PORT HARCOURT (Sundiata Post) – Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has stated that the  people  of  the state were committed to  peaceful and credible  polls, stressing  that  the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and security agencies  must work  within the  law so as not to provoke violence.

Wike  also condemned  the  death of soldiers  in a gun battle with sea pirates, but pointed out  that  the  unfortunate  incident  had nothing  to  do  with  the rerun  elections. Speaking  when he granted  audience  to the Consul-General of the United States Embassy in Nigeria, Mr John Bray on Friday, the governor  regretted that  result sheets were missing for some wards in the state ahead of  the rerun elections,  pointing  out  that  the vigilance  of PDP agents revealed  the  untoward situation. The governor  explained  that  the PDP  continued to  raise alarm because  of its commitment to credible and peaceful  polls. He said Rivers State people believe that officials  of INEC  and security agencies  must not take actions that would engender violence during and after the elections. [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”70560″] “Rivers State is key to this country. Let nobody think that anything  can happen  to  Rivers State”, the governor  said.

He said that his administration was supporting security agencies with logistics  and  finances to fight cult-ralated violence  in the state, pointing out  that  the security  agencies were bringing  the situation  under control. In his remarks,  the Consul-General said that the team was in the state as part of international  observers  to  ensure peaceful, credible,  free and fair  rerun  elections on March 19.
