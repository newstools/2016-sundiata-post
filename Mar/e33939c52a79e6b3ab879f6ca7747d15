Abuja –  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately release all final results of Saturday’s legislative re-run elections in Rivers. This call is contained in a statement signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Chief Olisa Metuh, on Monday in Abuja. INEC had early on Monday announced the suspension of release of further results of the elections due to reports of “violence, attacks and even the deaths of INEC officials and ad hoc personnel in the state’’. The PDP alleged that the reason for withholding of the results was the fact that its candidates were in clear and overwhelming victory in all the re-runs. It added that the delay in the release of results was a plot to rob PDP of its victory. “We wish to remind the All Progressives Congress (APC) and INEC that Rivers is a known stronghold of the PDP and the results from the elections cannot show otherwise.[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”70560″] “INEC should therefore understand that Nigerians are aware that in withholding the final results, they are ostensibly preparing grounds for chaos in the state. “We caution INEC to extricate itself from the evil web and immediately release all the final results of the ballot as cast by the people and nothing more,” it said. The party decried the conduct of INEC and security operatives in the elections, saying that the election “falls short of the expected standard, given the level of mobilization and preparedness.” It also expressed disappointment with INEC “under the leadership of Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, for not being able to conduct any conclusive election in few constituencies and states so far’’. “One wondered what would be the case when the entire country is involved,” it added.
