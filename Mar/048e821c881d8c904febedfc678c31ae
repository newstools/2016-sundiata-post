Akure – The Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) in Ondo State said on Sunday that it had prosecuted 40 persons for allegedly selling fake and substandard goods. The Coordinator of the organisation, Mr Paul Oke, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Akure that SON also helped 20 consumers to either retrieve from the dealers, the money they paid for the substandard goods, or be supplied with quality goods as replacement for the substandard ones. He said that the dealers were prosecuted for selling products, which did not carry SON’s cap. “We have prosecuted 40 offenders for engaging in businesses involving fake and substandard products in recent years. “Any product without SON’s cap is seized and the seller or merchant prosecuted. The person, on conviction, pays a penalty to the Federal Government,’’ he said. Oke advised consumers to send all complaints on substandard products to the organisation to enable it to achieve its mandate. “We ensure that consumers have confidence in goods they buy; therefore, complaints are welcome from them and their complaints are treated free of charge. “Complainants should just come with letters and purchase receipts of the faulty products.[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”70560″] “We will ensure that such a product is changed or the money paid for it returned to the consumer,’’ he said. The coordinator said that SON had always advised cottage industries in the country to ensure that the quality of their products were of high standard to encourage consumers to buy the products and help grow the country’s economy. “We ensure that any product within the country is of good quality and ask members of the public to give us feedback on products in markets. “This is to enable us to work on any faulted area,’’ he added. He warned merchants against importing substandard products to the country and urged Nigerians to patronise Nigeria-made products. (NAN)
