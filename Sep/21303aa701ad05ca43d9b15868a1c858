By Maureen Ojinaka-Nwanosike Enugu –  The Commissioner of Police in Enugu State, Mr Emmanuel Ojukwu, has commended the command’s spokesman, Mr Ebere Amaraizu, for writing a book to enhance police-public relations. Ojukwu made the commendation after receiving copies of the book on behalf of the command in Enugu on Thursday. He, however, challenged officers and men of the command to come up with intellectual works to strengthen police-public relations. “I have read the book and discover that it meets the yearnings of those seeking to maintain effective and functional relationship which in turn facilitates mutual understanding and remove communication gap. “The book will equally serve as a veritable material for practitioners of public relations, protocol management as well as a guide for those that want to be public relations professionals,’’ he said. He advised officers and men of the command to read the book. “This book will help you carry out your duties with mutual understanding of the members of the public.’’ Earlier, Amaraizu said that the ever changing face of the public relations profession prompted his desire to write the book. He added that he was motivated to embark on the exercise to advance the cause of police-public relations. The image maker stressed the need for proper enlightenment to enhance mutual and beneficial relationship between the police and members of the public. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the book, titled “Public Relations – A Practical Approach,’’ will be presented to the public on Sept. 23.
