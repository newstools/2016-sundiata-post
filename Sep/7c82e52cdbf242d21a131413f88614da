By Awayi Kuje Nasarawa –  The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party Board of Trustees (BOT), Sen.Walid Jibrin, on Wednesday said the party would loose nothing over the defection of Sen.Abubakar Sodangi to the APC. Jibrin told newsmen in Nasarawa, his country home in Nasarawa State, that the accusation of impunity against the PDP by Sodangi was laughable. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Sodangi, served as senator for Nasarawa west between 1999 to 2011 under the PDP. He defected from the party to the All Progressive Congress [APC] due to what he called the inability of the PDP to purge itself of impunity and imposition of candidates. The BOT chairman, however, dismissed the claim, insisting that the party, especially in the state, would not be affected by the defection. “I don’t want to mention Sodangi’s name because I have no business mentioning his name as we suffered to mobilise and vote for him as senator three consecutive times from 1999 to 2011 under our great party, PDP. “Even if somebody is blind, reasons given by him for his defection is laughable. “After you benefited so much and served for 12 years in the senate under PDP, you are coming today saying impunity made you to leave PDP, who are the people that caused the impunity. “If Sodangi said we are not doing things correctly for the past 12 years, why didnt he correct us then, and who will now agree with him that he is not part of the impunity.” According to him, several efforts were made to discuss issues affecting the party with Sodangi, but that the senator “ran away.” Jibrin assured that the PDP would provide level playing field to all its members aspiring for any electove position under its platform.
