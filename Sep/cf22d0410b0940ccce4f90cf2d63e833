By Afusat Agunbiade-Oladipo Ilorin –  The wife of the Kwara Deputy Governor, Mrs Felicia Kisira, has challenged parents to take proper care of their children for them to live a healthy life. Kisira made the call on Wednesday while addressing the people of Gaa Lapongba, off Afon road, Asa Local Government Area, during an eye treatment exercise carried out on children in the village. She said children and youths were the leaders of tomorrow, hence the need to guide them through the right path for the future of the country. She, therefore, called on parents and guardians to make the health of their children and wards a top priority and visit the nearest medical centre in case of emergencies and any health challenges. She restated the commitment of the government to give the welfare of the youths and women a pride of place. The leader of the medical team carrying out the eye treatment, Dr O. T. Bodunde, told newsmen that the benefitting children would be examined
and given treatment in all eye related cases. Bodunde said that more than 50 children had so far benefitted from the exercise.
