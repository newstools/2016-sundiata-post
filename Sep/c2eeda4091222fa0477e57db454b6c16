Ilorin- The Kwara Government has warned proprietors of schools that were shut down against re-opening them without meeting set standard. Hajiya Maryam Garba, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development, gave the warning while speaking with newsmen on Saturday in Ilorin. Garba recalled that 10 schools in Baboko, Adebata and Isale Aluko in Ilorin were closed down three months ago for not meeting statutory requirements of the ministry. “Most of the schools (closed schools) were being run in decrepit structures and unhealthy environment. “The assessment team from the ministry, who conducted checks round the schools in Ilorin, said there is little to differentiate between some classrooms, living rooms and kitchen. “Cooking utensils and mattresses were sighted in classrooms during the visit,’’ she said. Garba reiterated that the state would not tolerance proprietors, who failed to comply with statutory requirements of the ministry in setting up schools. She said that the ministry was determined to rid the state of schools which do not meet standard. “As soon as we return from Eid el-kabir holiday, our officials will return to those schools to confirm their level of compliance and any erring proprietor would be sanctioned,’’ she said. Garba added that it was unlawful for anyone to re-open shut down schools without approval from the appropriate authority and warned parents against enrolling their children in unaccredited schools. The permanent secretary said that there would be promotion examination in some schools in the state where the exercise could not hold after the Sallah break.
