Abuja – Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau has expressed deep shock over the news of the sudden death of Malam Sani Adamu, a director of the News Agency of Nigeria ((NAN). The governor  in a statement issued on Monday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Mark Longyen, commiserated with the family of the deceased. Lalong also commiserated with the Management  and staff of NAN, as well as the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) and Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) over the death of late Adamu. Lalong, who recounted his last encounter with the late Adamu in May, when he featured on a NAN Media Forum, co-anchored by the deceased, described him as a professional journalist. He also described the deceased as an “accomplished, distinguished thoroughbred professional journalist and one in a million who would be greatly missed by many.” He said the late journalist contributed immeasurably to the development of democracy and journalism profession in Nigeria and beyond. He said he was a “prolific features writer, who rose to the zenith of his career in NAN and played conspicuously crucial roles as a prominent member of the NGE and NUJ before his death.”
The governor  urged the younger journalists he left behind to emulate him while praying God to grant the family, people and government of Kebbi the fortitude to bear the “irreparable loss. Lalong, therefore, admonished those he left behind to take solace in the fact that death is an inevitable end for all men. The governor also prayed God to grant the deceased journalist eternal rest and peaceful repose of his soul. NAN reports that the late Malam Sani Adamu was the Managing Editor/Director, Multi Media Services of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Adamu, 54, who died in Abuja on Sunday following a brief illness, had since been buried according to Islamic rites. Edited by Felix Ajide
