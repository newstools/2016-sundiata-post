Bunkure (Kano State)-Kano State Government says over 5, 540 registered rice farmers will benefit from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Anchor Borrower programme in the state. Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje made the disclosure during the launch of the programme in Bunkure town, Headquarters of Bunkure Local Government Area of Kano state on Thursday. Ganduje said that 5,540 farmers in the state had registered and completed the necessary documentations required by the CBN to qualify them to access the loan. He said that over 4,000 applications for other farmers were currently with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) awaiting approval. The governor advised farmers in the state to make good use of the opportunity provided them by the Federal Government through the CBN to boost rice production in the state and the country at large. The governor restated the commitment of the state government toward giving priority attention to agriculture for massive food production in the state. Earlier in his remarks, the representative of CBN, Mr Umar Ambursah, said that the Anchor Borrowers’ programme was designed to create economic linkages between farmers and processors. He said that it will also bridge the gap between production and consumption, and ensure improved output of rice and wheat. Ambursah said that the CBN had set aside N20 billion from the N220 billion Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund (MSMEDF) to be made available to farmers with single digit interest rate. ”Our target is to link at least 100,000 rice and wheat farmers with reputable millers for off-take of the paddy produced,’’ he said. Ambursah then commended the State Government for its continued support to farmers in a bid to make the programme a reality in Kano state.
