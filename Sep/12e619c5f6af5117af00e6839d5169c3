By Ngozi Njoku Lagos –  A 21-year-old security guard, Sunday Nnamoku, who allegedly broke into an estate auditorium in Lagos and stole some items including a plasma TV worth N149, 500, was on Thursday brought before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court. The accused, whose address is unknown, is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. According to the prosecutor, Sgt. Lucky Ihiehie, the complainant, Chief Onamo Agboyi, reported the incident at Ketu Police Station on Sept. 4. Ihiehie said the complainant, who owned Agboyi Estate in Ketu area, had engaged Nnamoku and three other accomplices as security guards. He said the accused and three others still at large allegedly conspired and broke into the estates’ auditorium and stole some valuables. “The complainant reported that the items taken from the auditorium include an executive plasma television set valued at N45, 000 and a medium plasma television set valued at N 85, 000 respectively. “Other items stolen include two stabilisers and two uninterruptible power supply (UPS) attached to the plasma tv valued at N 19, 500.’’ Ihiehie alleged that the accused kept the stolen items in a nearby bush in a valley to sell them. “The place is where hoodlums buy and sell stolen goods. The Police on receiving the report, swung into action by invading the location.” The offences contravened Sections 285, 305 (b) and 409 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011. Nnamoku, however, pleaded not guilty. The Magistrate, Mrs O. Sule-Amzat, admitted the accused to a bail of N20, 000 with two sureties in like sum, one of who must be a blood relation with an evidence of gainful employment. The case was adjourned to Nov. 22 for mention.
