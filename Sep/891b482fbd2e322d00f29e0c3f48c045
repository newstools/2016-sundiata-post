By Muhyideen Jimoh Abuja –  The Commandant General, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Abdullahi Muhammadu, said he had ordered a renewed onslaught on pipeline vandals and illegal refineries in the Niger Delta. Muhammadu disclosed this on Thursday in Abuja at a media briefing on the activities on the corps. He said following the order, 50 pipeline vandals and 15 illegal refineries operators were arrested on Wednesday night in Rivers. The NSCDC boss, who decried the spate of vandalism in the region, said that the renewed onslaught was meant to check economic sabotage on critical infrastructure in the region and the country. “There is renewed onslaught on the vandals, even yesterday my commandant in Rivers state called me that she led a team that destroyed 15 illegal refineries and about 50 vandals were arrested and they will soon be charged to court,’’ he said. Muhammadu said that the establishment of a 24-hour Command and Control Centre in Abuja had aided the corps in monitoring pipelines in Niger Delta with over 450 illegal refineries destroyed in the last one year. He said that the corps had also begun special training and deployment of some of its personnel to mining sites, railways, dams, farms and cattle ranches to ensure adequate security. “We have received letters from the ministers of mines and steel, agriculture and water resources for the protection of some of these facilities. “I can assure that training and deployment of personnel to some of these critical areas has begun,’’ he said. He said that the corps was working round the clock to ensure better welfare for its personnel, but charged them to be professional in carrying out their duties.
