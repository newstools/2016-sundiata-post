Benin – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Thursday dispelled rumours of postponement of the Sept. 10 governorship election in Edo. Mr Solomon Soyebi, INEC National Commissioner in-charge of Voter Education and Publicity, said during a press conference held at INEC’s office in Benin, that “the governorship election will go ahead on Saturday, Sept. 10 as scheduled.’’ Soyebi, who said INEC as the body statutorily set up to conduct elections in the country, would not take orders from any institution with regard to the performance of its constitutional duties. “We have therefore weighed all the consequences of a postponement in the election and have resolved to go ahead with the conduct of the election on Saturday as scheduled,’’ he said.(NAN)
