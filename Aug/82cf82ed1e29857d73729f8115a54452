Abuja –  The Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC) has urged the Federal Government to support organisations such as the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), to enable it to realise its mandate. A statement signed by Mr Celestine Ogugua, the Head, Media Unit of the commission and made available to newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja, said that the Executive Secretary, Rev. Tor Uja, made the call when the management staff of JAMB paid him a courtesy visit. Uja also said that JAMB should be given the opportunity to interface with vice-chancellors of universities and rectors of polytechnics, to understand more about their vision and mission. He commended JAMB for the successful conduct of the 2016 online medical examination for medical personnel for the 2016 pilgrimage to Israel, Rome and Greece, saying:“We will like to build on that relationship.’’ While urging JAMB to sustain its efficiency in service delivery, Uja appealed to the commission to sponsor their Christian staff for the Holy pilgrimage. “This country needs to support JAMB, to bring about intellectual equilibrium.’’ He stressed the need for JAMB to be commended for conducting credible and transparent exams over the years. Earlier, Mr John Okonkwo, the Director, Quality Assurance of JAMB, who represented the registrar, congratulated the NCPC boss on his appointment. Okonkwo pledged the support of the Board to sustain a working relationship between the two organisations. (NAN)
