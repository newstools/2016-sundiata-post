Okitipupa –  A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Ondo State, Mr Solomon Bitire, says the national leadership tussle that led to the botched national convention in Port Harcourt is only a temporary challenge.
Bitire, PDP Chairman in Okitipupa Local Government Area of Ondo State, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Okitipupa on Thursday.
He said that the PDP, in spite of the trouble rocking it, remained a very strong political party in the country and in Ondo State.
NAN recalls that ahead of the convention, leadership tussle suits led to two court orders, with one saying it should go on, while another stopped it from holding,
The party’s convention scheduled to hold on Wednesday at the Sharks Stadium, Port Harcourt to elect new leaders was, eventually, unable to hold as there was high security presence at the venue.
Following the development, the PDP extended the tenure of the Ahmed Markarfi-led National Caretaker Committee by one year.
Bitire frowned at the action of the factional leader, ex-governor Ali-Modu Sheriff, whose suit led to the order stopping the convention.
He said that the problem currently facing the party “ is just a temporary one, which I believe it is surmountable.
“There is only one PDP in Nigeria and in Ondo state as at today and that is the Ahmed Markafi-led Caretaker Committee, which is recognised by the law,” he said.
The chairman, therefore, urged indigenes of the state to stay with the PDP, saying it was the only one that could restore hopes of the masses. (NAN)
