Abuja – The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), through its South East Zonal Head of Operations, Mr Obioha Okorie, has released a bank draft of N500,000 to one Dr. Veronica Ibeziako, a retired Chief Magistrate in Anambra. A statement issued by Mr Wilson Uwujaren, the commission`s Head of Media and Publicity on Thursday in Abuja, said that the money was recovered for Ibeziako. “The former magistrate was swindled by fraudsters while seeking for financial assistance to enable her to proceed for medical treatment abroad,’’ the statement quoted Uwujaren as saying. Uwujaren said in the statement that Ibeziako was billed for a surgical procedure abroad, which was going to cost N3 million, adding that she was defrauded of N500,000. The EFCC spokesman said that though investigations into the matter were still ongoing, the recovered fund had been released to the victim. This, he said, was to enable her to attend to her financial and medical needs. (NAN)
