Second Republic politician, who was once the Special Adviser to the President on National Assembly, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, has said the All Progressives Congress, APC, will lose the 2019 presidential election. According to him, APC has no chance of winning if the exercise is free and fair. The elder statesman said this on Saturday when High Chief Raymond Dokpesi led members of his campaign team to his Kano residence to seek his support for the position of Chairmanship of the PDP at the forthcoming national convention billed for Port Harcourt. Yakasai said, “Because the state of poverty and cost of living is on the increase, in my opinion, Nigerians will vote out APC in 2019. “Nigerians are complaining. I don’t see how APC will win if they don’t manipulate the process. Nigerians will return PDP to power in 2019.”
