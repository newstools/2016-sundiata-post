Ijebu-Ode –  The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has advised the Federal Government to initiate policies that will encourage local production of tyres in the country, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. Mr Austin Ekele, the Assistant Corps Commander, FRSC, Ijebu-Ode Unit, said it would forestall the risk commuters and motorists were exposed to through the patronage of used tyres, also known as `Tokunbo’ tyres. He urged the FG to woo recognised tyre manufacturers back into the country as this would help bring down the price of new tyres and curb patronage of used tyres. “Tyres are one of the most important components of any vehicle because without it, no matter the condition of the car, it will not be mobile. “With the right tyres, inflated to the right pressure and moving at a controlled speed, the assurance of safety on the roads is near perfect excluding unforeseen circumstances. “That is why government must do all to make Nigerians have access to quality tyres at affordable prices to check the menace of `tokunbo’ tyres but promote road safety,” Ekele said. The FRSC head said the corps would continue to sensitise motorists on proper vehicle maintenance procedures and the need to maintain sanity why plying the roads. Similarly, FRSC Dep. Route Commander in Ago-Iwoye, Adebola Olotu, advised motorists to desist from buying and using used tyres to prevent crashes. He alleged that most tyres fixed to several many vehicles were expired ones. “Most of our drivers are ignorant of the fact that tyres have expiry dates and this is visible in most crashes where most tyres have been found to have already expired. “To ensure safety, motorists must try as much as possible to purchase new tyres that can guarantee their safety. “They must also take necessary precautions while driving and take cognisance of other road users by being civil and giving pedestrians consideration,” Olotu said.
