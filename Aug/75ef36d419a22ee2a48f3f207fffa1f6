Wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, Aisha, has drummed support for continuity of the All Progressives Congress, APC, leadership in Edo state. Aisha assured the candidate of the APC in the Edo State governorship election, Godwin Obaseki, of massive support from women in the state during the election in September. She stated this during a meeting with the Godwin Obaseki Campaign Organisation in Benin on Tuesday. The wife of the President, who was represented by the APC Women Leader in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Mrs. Hailmary Aipoh, said, “The APC has done well for Edo people and that is why we are saying continuity. “Governor Oshiomhole is our great brother who has done us proud in Edo State with his developmental projects; so we are always with him.” She explained that the incumbent Governor Adams Oshiomhole had lived up to expectations, through the developmental projects recorded by the state government, adding that the party’s candidate had proven himself to be qualified to succeed the governor. She, however, noted that, “he (Obaseki) must remember our women and children when he wins because he will win.” The meeting also came shortly after a visit to the Internally Displaced Persons camp in Uhogua, where several items were donated.
