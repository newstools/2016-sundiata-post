By Remi Bamgbose Okitipupa – The Ilaje Indigenes Descendants Association, UK chapter, on Wednesday canvassed support for Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), the All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial candidate in the Nov. 26 election in Ondo State. Mr Bolaji Odidi, the president of the association, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Okitipupa that the association supported Akeredolu because of his outstanding qualities and honesty in public service. According to Odidi, Akeredolu is resolute, honest, truthful and he is a special breed politician, who will find it difficult to renege on his electoral promises for the masses. “Our people have gone through hard times in the last eight years, no jobs, no salary for workers and there is lack of social amenities among other things. “Akeredolu is an upright person and he possesses the required qualities of leadership; he will surely serve the interest of our people, that is why we support him,” he said. Odidi, therefore, urged the people to vote for Akeredolu, the APC candidate, who would support and work for their interest.
