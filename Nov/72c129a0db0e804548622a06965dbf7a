Lagos –  A Nollywood movie distributor, Alex Nweke, on Saturday said that proper structuring of the movie industry would enable it to create more jobs. Nweke told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that Nollywood, through its distribution network, had provided jobs for many foreigners in their home countries, and could do same locally. According to Nweke, the movie industry is not only profound in entertainment but has become a money spinning venture. “Our stagnancy in Nollywood is not predicated on the amount of money we generate but the inability to channel these funds appropriately. “Sometimes I ask: When we will have one umbrella body to run the affairs of practitioners, investors and other industry affiliates through a basic system. “If we achieve that, then, we can drive the sector in search of more funds by extending our reach, and by so doing, providing opportunities to rewrite the unemployment trend in Nigeria,” he said. Nweke claimed that major stakeholders were building their brands alone and not ensuring a befitting structure for other brands to thrive. “If the industry is properly managed, a million more jobs will be generated, but who wants to sit down to do the right thing? “No doubt, government has a role to play but the success the industry has seen so far, shows that there are people who can make it happen but they are not doing it,” he said.
