By Ehigimetor Igbaugba Benin –  The vicinity in and around the Samuel Ogbemudia stadium, where the new Governor of Edo, Mr Godwin Obaseki, will take his oath of office has been put under tight security and heavy surveillance. Security personnel drawn from the Police, Army, Department of State Security and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, have been positioned in the area to forestall any unforeseen security breach. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the road leading to the stadium and other adjoining streets within the precinct of the stadium are under heavy surveillance by security personnel. NAN also reports that although the surrounding area of the stadium is heavily guarded, there is free-flow of traffic to and from the stadium due to the presence of the police and officials of the Federal Road Safety Commission. Former governor of the state, Adams Oshiomhole, whose government was inaugurated on Nov. 12, 2008, handed over the reign to Obaseki last night at a brief ceremony at the Government House in Benin. NAN reports that Obaseki, who is of the All Progressives Congress, had on Sept, 28, won the Edo governorship election of Sept. 28 by defeating the People Democratic Party candidate, Mr Osagie Ize-Iyamu.
