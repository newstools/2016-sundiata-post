Okitipupa  –  Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for Nov. 26 governorship election in Ondo State, has promised to revive the state, if elected. Akeredolu made the promise during his campaign in Okitipupa Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. He also promised to restore electricity in Okitipupa LGA given that the area has not had power supply for more than two years. “We are poised to revive Ondo State and make the state viable again and restore the state’s old glory. “The youths and women shall be empowered to take their rightful places. “We have taken stock of the wants of our people in Okitipupa LGA. “We shall restore electricity in Okitipupa LGA that has been in total darkness for the past two years now,’’ Akeredolu said. He solicited the support of residents of Okitipupa LGA and urged them to go out en masse on the governorship election day and vote for APC. Earlier, Akeredolu and his running mate, Mr Agboola Ajayi, were offered `royal blessings’ by the Olu-Iju of Iju-Odo, Oba Raphael Olumoyegun, and the Majuwa of Ilutitun, Oba Samuel Idepefo. NAN reports that a mammoth crowd thronged Okitipupa round-about, venue of the campaign to show support to Akeredolu and his political associates.
