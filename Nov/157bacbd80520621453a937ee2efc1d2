By Bashir Rabe Mani Sokoto – The Sokoto State Government says it has deployed 175 Medical Doctors, Nurses and Midwives to Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in Sokoto city and environs. The Commissioner of Health, Dr Balarabe Kakale, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Sokoto on Sunday. Kakale said the decision was part of measures to reduce extreme pressure on the state’s Specialist Hospital, as well as the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, in Sokoto. ”The deployed medical personnel comprise 23 Medical Doctors; 152 Nurses and Midwives. ”This excludes the conventional medical personnel who normally man such centres such as the community health extension workers. ”The staff deployed in this direction are not, therefore, taking over the PHCs, but they are just to complement the existing staff,” he said. The commissioner also said that the measure was to bring quality healthcare closer to the people, as well as improve immunisation , maternal health and strengthen primary healthcare. According to him, the PHCs were now more empowered to operate effectively. ”The core mandate of these centres include antenatal care, treatment of simple ailments such as malaria, enforcing environmental sanitation laws, referrals and other related issues.
