She said that the suspect had given relevant information to the police on how he came across the harmful items, saying that prosecution would commence after full investigation. She added that the command was beaming its searchlight on activities of all political parties to ensure that criminality was not allowed. Ibifuro-Harrison assured that criminal activities would not be tolerated in the state. According to her, there was full security presence in all nooks and crannies of the state. She said that over 25, 000 police personnel would be deployed for the Saturday election. Speaking to newsmen, Ade said that he was not aware that the dangerous items were in the bus, adding that he was only a photographer meant to cover a political rally in the area. The suspect stated that his co-passengers ran away immediately the items were found in the bus.
