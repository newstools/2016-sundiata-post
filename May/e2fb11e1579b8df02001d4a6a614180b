Lokoja –  A political group, Igala/Bassa Forum, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a supplementary election to fill the remaining senatorial seat in the state. Some members of the group, led by its chairman, Mr Hassan Yakubu, made this call on Monday in Lokoja. The group stated that the development had denied the people of Kogi East representation in the Senate for the past one year, saying that they could no longer withstand the situation. “The people are now eager for the election to hold, as they feel that they are being disenfranchised,” the group said. Yakubu also stressed the need for the INEC to conclude the elections to fill the Idah and Ofu State Assembly seats without any further delay. “No attempt should be made to disenfranchise a large population as ours under any circumstances. Igala/Bassa land is peaceful but how long can this be taken for weakness,” he said. The group urged INEC to quickly do the needful by conducting supplementary elections to fill the vacant seats, so that the people could continue to enjoy the dividends of democracy. The INEC Head, General Administration and Personnel, Mr Julius Yagba, urged the group to help sensitise the people on the need to create a conducive atmosphere for a credible supplementary election. Yagba said that he would convey the people’s demands to the commission’s headquarters, following which a final date would be scheduled for the election.
