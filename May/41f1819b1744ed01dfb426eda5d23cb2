ILORIN – Giwa FC of Jos, Plateau, on Sunday failed to show up for their Week 14 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL)encounter billed for the Kwara Stadium Complex. It will be recalled that the League Management Company (LMC) recently banished the Jos team to Ilorin after violence by fans during their home match with Rangers of Enugu in the 74th minute in a Week 13 NPFL game. The Centre Referee, Henry Ogunyanmodi from Ondo State, called off the match at 4.20p.m. to satisfy the ‘Walk Over’ formalities.
NAN reports that Wikki Tourists players and officials were present for the game. The referee said he would write his report according to what happened. The Coach of Wikki Tourists, Abdul Maikaba, in an interview with NAN urged LMC to apply the rules accordingly by awarding three points three goals to his side. The captain of the visiting side, Hassan Hussein, said it was sad the host team did not show up because the game plan was to beat it in Ilorin. Hussein urged LMC to award his side three points and three goals.(NAN)
