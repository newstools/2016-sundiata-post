Omu-Aran  –  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it shifted the by-election for Oke-Ero Local Government Constituency in Kwara following a request by the PDP. Mr Jacob Ayanda, the commission’s Deputy Director of Voters’ Education in the state, made the clarification on Friday during a stakeholders meeting in Iloffa, headquarters of the council area. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the by-election earlier scheduled to hold on May 21 had now been postponed to May 28. The commission had also tentatively picked May 19 as the last day for political campaign. Ayanda said the PDP had in a letter requested for the shift in the election date so as to avoid a clash with the party’s national convention in Abuja on May 21. He, however, said that other schedules regarding the election remained unchanged. “The new date was sequel to the request made by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to avoid a clash with its national convention in Abuja. “The PDP wrote to us regarding its desire for a date change which we forwarded to our headquarters in Abuja and they granted the new date of May 28, 2016,” Ayanda said. He said the commission had on March 4 received notification from the Clerk of the State House of Assembly on the demise of the lawmaker representing Oke-Ero Constituency, Hon. Musa Afolayan. His wife, Victoria, also secured the party’s ticket to contest the re-run election. She emerged unopposed at a primary conducted by a five-man team from the national headquarters of the APC in Abuja.
