 Governor Ambode noted that the deficiency which Nigeria is currently experiencing in the economy as a result of the forex challenges was a pointer to the fact that all hands must be on deck to carry out some kind of structural adjustment on the economy and encourage the manufacturing of products needed by Nigerians in Nigeria. Governor Amobde, however, commended the strategies adopted so far by President Muhammadu Buhari to address the challenges confronting the economy, and solicited the support of all Nigerians in ensuring the success of the current efforts of the Federal Government.

He said: “The issues at stake are more about a short term deficiency that we are experiencing in the economy. We don’t believe that the issue of foreign exchange will last forever and it is something that is solvable but then, it is a pointer to the fact that there has to be some kind of structural adjustment in this economy and everybody has to start to look inward. The governor also reiterated the commitment of his administration to always create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive, especially by placing much priority on the safety of lives and property and improving on the infrastructure in the state. “We know that if we have a safer Lagos, it creates more opportunities for your investment to thrive and it also creates job opportunities for our people and within that context, we will be able to get more revenue as taxes and also improve upon infrastructure and allow the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Lagos to grow and so we have that commitment that we will improve on whatever it is that we are doing and ensure ease of doing business,” he said.
