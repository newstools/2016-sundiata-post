ABUJA (Sundiata Post) – The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has refuted online reports (not from Sundiata Post) saying it has sent a message of congratulation to former Senate President, Senator David Mark, who was on Sunday morning declared winner of the Benue Southern Senatorial District election re-run held on Saturday.
According to a statement sent to Sundiata Post by Edegbe Odemwingie, the party’s assistant director, publicity, the party had not issued any congratulatory message on
the Benue South Senatorial rerun election. “The ‘congratulatory message’ purportedly obtained from a twitter handle, @APCNigeria did not emanate from the party. The purported twitter message itself is not credited to any APC official.
“The general public is advised to ignore the false message,” the statement said. The APC reiterated that only the national chairman and the national secretary officially speak for the party.
David Mark of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had been declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over Daniel Onjeh of the APC in the Benue South senatorial election re-run.
