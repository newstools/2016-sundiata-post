ABUJA (Sundiata Post) – The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it is shocked by some misleading media reports suggesting that the party is broke. The party’s national secretary, Mai Mala Buni in a statement said: “The APC is not broke as erroneously reported. The concerned news mediums have unfairly and unethically twisted and misrepresented comments by the party’s national chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun.” The statement released the transcript of Odigie-Oyegun’s statement on the issue of party funding during an interactive session with journalists at the APC headquarters in Abuja on Monday January 25.

That also goes to tell you that we are not a party that withdraws money from security votes or from any government agency. “We are working on plans to raise money from within the memberships. That plan has matured and will soon put it into operation. I saw reports that we have written to the president to rescue the party. That is not part of his national duties and he has no intention because there are no funds from which he can draw from. “The party has to come up with fresh and innovative ways as to how to raise resources for its operations and that, we have done. The plan is ready and will go into operation in the next one month or two.”
