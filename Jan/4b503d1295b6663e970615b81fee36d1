Bauchi  –  Bauchi State chapter of Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ has protested the non-inclusion of female’s category in the on-going media games in the state. In an interview with NAN on Friday, Vice Chairman of NAWOJ in the state, Mrs Bulak Afsa, lamented the non-inclusion of female category. “’It is possible to have female categories in games like table-tennis, lawn-tennis and volleyball, unfortunately there is no such arrangement.
“We have just been left with the role of cheering the participants, without being fully part of the events,” she said. Miss Susan Edeh, Reporter with Vanguard Newspapers, told NAN that because there was no provision for female’s category, she opted to join her male counterparts in forming the football team for the Correspondents’ Chapel. She said she had passion for the game of football and as such decided to play in the midst of males.
“It was interesting playing the match and I enjoyed it because I have passion for football, ” she said. Reacting to the complaints in an interview with NAN, Chairman, Sport Writers Association of
Nigeria (SWAN), Bauchi chapter, Alhaji Nasiru Kobi, apologised to female journalist in
the state for not introducing women categories.
