Lagos – The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and industry (LCCI) on Monday said that states should be allowed to promote and practise agriculture in the areas they have comparative advantages. Mr Adeola Elliot, the Chairman, Agric and Agro-Allied Sector of LCCI told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that this would enhance keen competition among the states. Elliot said this would also encourage bumper harvest of farm produce and engender employment opportunities for many. He, however, said that having grazing routes around the country was not necessary. According to him, ”If states in the Northern part of the country see grazing as part of what they can promote as their own agriculture, they should develop grazing lands in there.
”If Lagos is interested in fishing, it should be allowed to utilise part of its land it and not be bothered about grazing. ”However, any state that is interesting in grazing should provide grazing lands and not routes for such activity,” he said. Elliot said that farmers interested in husbandry and dairy farms should also be allowed to have expanse of land for grazing. He said that the genuine Fulani herdsmen knew where to pasture their animals and would not go any village to destroy farm crops. The chairman said that those entering villages and towns destroying farm crops were not herdsmen and that the law enforcement agencies should arrest them for interrogation. Elliot said that genuine herdsmen sourced all kinds of foods from their cattle for their wives to sell. He advised the various state governments to set aside large expanse of land in their states for lease to herdsmen for husbandry and grazing. NAN)
