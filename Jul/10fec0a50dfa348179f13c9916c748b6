By Wale Odunsi Former acting chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of using the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to subdue the opposition. Lamenting the arrest and prosecution of members of the PDP in the past year, Secondus told The Punch that Buhari’s aim is to “kill” PDP. “There is absolute absence of the rule of law in the pursuit of this anti-corruption crusade,” he said. “We in the PDP are in total support of the anti-corruption fight but we believe that due process and the rule of law are not being followed. “We are not in a garrison command structure, a person can be invited or arrested if he resists but the rule of law must be followed. “We know there are ex-governors who are ministers now, why are they not probing them? Why are they not inviting them? It is absolutely wrong. “The partiality is obvious now, and Nigerians know, the world now knows that the agenda of this government is to kill the PDP “It is absolutely wrong to say PDP feels comfortable with corruption. Let me ask this question, if the PDP had no interest in fighting corruption, would we have set up the EFCC, ICPC (Independent Corrupt Practices Commission) and all other institutions? “All these institutions were set up by the then President Olusegun Obasanjo who headed a PDP-led government”, he added.
