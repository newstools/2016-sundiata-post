Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Steering Committee on Fund Raising for membership registration in Ughelli North Local Government Area, Delta State, Olorogun Jaro Egbo, has affirmed that the party would sack the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the 2019 general election. Speaking during a meeting of the party in Ughelli, yesterday, to kick-off the ongoing membership registration exercise, Egbo said that PDP had failed in the state. He said: “We are here to consolidate our membership drive in Ughelli North council. “Those here are made up of the former Labour Party, Social Democratic Party, SDP, Accord Party members and those who were formerly in PDP. They have all come together as members of one strong and virile APC in Ughelli North.”
