Enugu –  Enugu State Government says it will continue to fix failed portions of federal roads in the state in spite of the N22.8 billion being owed it by the government for rehabilitation of federal roads. The Commissioner for Information, Dr Godwin Udeuhele, made the statement on Friday in Enugu while briefing newsmen on the outcome of the meeting of the state Executive Council. He described the poor state of federal roads in the state as `worrisome.’ Udeuhele said the state government had previously spent huge amount of money in rehabilitating some federal roads in the state and expressed optimism that the money would be reimbursed in due time. He said that the state government could not afford to gloss over the deplorable state of the federal roads in the state. He said, “the roads are used by our people and their deplorable state is affecting economic activities.’’ Udeuhele said that the latest approval made by the government was the rehabilitation of some failed sections of Enugu-Onitsha highway at the cost of N114.8 million. According to the commissioner, the job was awarded to Comag Steel and Construction Company Ltd. “This approval is as a result of the negative effects of the poor state of the road on the economic and social life of the people. “It is also manifestation of the governor’s commitment to improve the lives of the people,” he said. The commissioner said that all was set for the simultaneous commencement of construction of road projects in all the 17 local government areas of the state on Saturday. He said that the council also approved the engagement of Trusthouse Investment Ltd. as investment adviser to the government. Udeuhele said the council gave approval that N880,307 be paid to him as his commission for the revenue he generated for the state.
