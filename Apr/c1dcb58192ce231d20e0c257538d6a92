Abuja –  The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has arrested the duo of Abbas Attahiru and Mohammed Sufiyanu for offences bordering on impersonation and obtaining money by false pretense. This, is contained in a statement issued by Mr Wilson Uwujaren, the commission`s Head of Media and Publicity on Friday in Abuja. According to the statement, Attahiru and Sufiyanu’s arrest followed a complaint by a would be victim that the suspects, claiming to be staff of EFCC, informed him of a petition purportedly written against him. The suspects, the statement added, promised to give the would be victim a “soft landing” provided he was ready to part with some money. This, he added, made him to suspect a foul play and contacted the commission where he was asked to play along. The statement re-emphasised that the EFCC does not solicit for nor accept payments or gratification from persons or organisations under any guise to settle matters. It added that the suspects were apprehended at the complainant’s home after collecting N100, 000 which was part of their agreed fee to quash the case.
